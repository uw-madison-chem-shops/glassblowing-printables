The adapters are "CuttingFixture.SLDPRT" and "thread and taper adapter.SLDPRT" which reference the "thread and taper adapter parameters.txt".
This .txt can be generated using "equationsGenerator.py" to fit with a variety of standard glass tapers and GL threads.
There is a limitation with the parameters, the pitch of the threads which must be adjusted manually in the spiral features.
The thread standards used are from https://www.gewinde-normen.de/en/knuckle-thread-din-168.html
