The V Block files are "VBlockParameterized.SLDPRT" and "vBlockStops.SLDPRT" which reference "VBlockEquations.txt".
The limitation of the parameterization is the holes in the top of the "vBlockStops.SLDPRT" which should be resized to fit different bolts.
The posted models use a M5x.8 tap hole.
VBlocks also have a hole parallel to the groove that can be tapped with a 1/4-20 thread to mound threaded rod to either extend the length or attach a flag.
